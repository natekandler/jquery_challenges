# Let's Learn JQuery!

## Learning Competencies

* DOM manipulation.
* DOM Traversal.
* Event binding.

## Summary
We will be using JQuery in place of vanilla JavaScript to select elements from the DOM, manipulate those element, and bind events to those elements.

[JQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a very popular library that allows us to use JavaScript with a friendly syntax. JQuery uses CSS selectors to find elements within the dom. We reference JQuery with a $ and then pass the element we are looking for in as an argument

```
 $(".myelement")
```

We can use the [JQuery Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/) to help us find the functions we need to complete the releases.

## Releases

### Release 0: Learn to travers the DOM
The DOM refers to document object model. This is the representation of the document (a webpage) as a tree structure that we navigate through.

Open up the index html file and use JQuery to access the following elements.
